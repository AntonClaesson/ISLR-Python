Exploration of the topics covered in chapter 1-9 of book <A target="_blank" href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Egareth/ISL/index.html'>'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'</A> by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).

The repository contains code for some of the lab exercises, but also code where the exploration of the topics was performed in other ways than following the exercises.
